"Game of life"
This small and basic project implements the "game of life" in python. It is
created to practice my python and Git knowledge and to provide a bit of fun to
Github community :).
================================================================================
The project is composed of two .py files:
        gameFunctions.py: where there are defined the rules to update the matrix
        each iteration.
        main.py: creates the seed and calls the rules from gameFunctions.py

To run the game type on terminal:
        python main.py

Parameters:
        @matrixIn: Should be modified manually to change output's behaviour

================================================================================
I create the project under Ubuntu, using conda environment. This environment
should have installed matplotlib and numpy python libraries.
